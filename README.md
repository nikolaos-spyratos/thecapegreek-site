# thecapegreek-site

> Personal site of Nik Spyratos, The Cape Greek

The intention is for this to be a statically-buildable Nuxt (Vue) site, using markdown pages for content. I live in my code editor, so I don't need an full-blown CMS.

## Why this 

- Before this, I'd been using [Grav CMS](getgrav.org) for my website. I love Grav and it's highly portable, except for still needing something to run and serve the PHP code. I'd like to go even lighter than that.
- I want to gain more Vue & Nuxt experience
- I want to build my own website theme, loosely (or largely) based on the existing Grav Portfolio theme I have used in the past, but with additional page types (e.g. better differentiation between blog and project lists & posts, and a standalone cv/showcase page)

So, three birds with one stone.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
